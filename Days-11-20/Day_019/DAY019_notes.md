# Higher Order Function
- Function that can work with other functions
- Function as inputs to another function
  - You don't need to include the brackets.
  - In the following example, func_b is a higher order function because
    it takes another function as an input:
    ```python
    def func_a():
      pass
    
    def func_b(func_a):
      pass
    ```
