# How to create your own Class in Python
- Class is a blueprint to create our own objects
- Syntax: `class` keyword followed by the `<className>` and end with a colon
- Naming convention for Class is to capitalize the first letter of every word.
For example: `CarCamshaftPulley`. This is also known as "PascalCase".

# Attributes, Class Constructors, \_\_init\_\_ Function





# Example Code
```python
class Car:
  pass
  

# Create an object instance of the class Car
car1 = Car()
car2 = Car()
```
